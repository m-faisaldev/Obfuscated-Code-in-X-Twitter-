# Obfuscated-Code-in-X-Twitter-
This project provides a detailed analysis of the obfuscation patterns found in the XApp.apk file, downloaded from Twitter (formerly X). The goal is to decompile and understand the structure of the application by reversing obfuscation, while documenting the tools and processes used.
